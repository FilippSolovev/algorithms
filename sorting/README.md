# Sorting algorithms

Various sorting algorithms: [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), [selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort), [Shell sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort) and [heapsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort).

# Example

The scripts can be run like any other Python scripts - type `python` followed by a script name and name of the file containing the array to sort.

~~~
$ python heap_sort.py tests/random/test_1.txt
~~~

To run tests with the [naive-tester](https://github.com/FilippSolovev/naive-tester) (it should be installed first) use the following command (here we have four sets of tests, so the name to the specific folder should be specified):

~~~
$ tester heap_sort.py tests/random
~~~

You can also run tests for all four sorting algorithms in the cloud by clicking on []()
